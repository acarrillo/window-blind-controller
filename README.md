# Automated Window Blind Controller
An Electric Imp-powered automated window blind controller, connected to Google Calendar and Weather Underground

This project simply opens the blinds in my dorm room according to a morning "wake up" schedule programmed in Google Calendar, and closes the blinds according to the sunset time posted in the astronomy data from the Weather Underground API. Of course, I have also bookmarked the URL calls to opening, closing, and trimming the blinds on my cellphone and computer, so that overriding the automated control schedule is always a button press away.

## Setup: Software

The easiest way to expose your morning schedule to the Imp agent server is to create a public Google Calendar and generate a corresponding API Key through the Google Developer Console.
